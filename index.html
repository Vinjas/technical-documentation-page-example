        <p>The major components of a dishwasher are made of steel and plastic. 
            The basic structure consists of a steel frame assembly and a steel door panel. 
            Sheets of stainless steel are purchased and fabricated in the required pieces and shapes 
            in the factory; both the door and the wrap-around cabinet for standalone models are 
            purchased as coiled sheet steel that has been prefinished in several standard colors. 
            Other small steel parts are designed in house but made by suppliers to the manufacturer's 
            specifications.</p>
        <p>The racks that hold the dishes are also made of steel, but it is delivered to the factory 
            as coiled wire. </p>
        <code>Coat the rack tines to prevent them from scratching dishes, the racks are
            dipped in plastic in the form of powder polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or nylon.</code> 
        <p>The inner box that holds the racks and the washer arms is called the tub. It is a single piece 
            (not counting the piece lining the inside of the door) that is injection-molded in the plant. 
            The injection molding is done with pellets of calcium-reinforced poly-propylene plastic. 
            This plastic is respected for its strength and for the fact that it is inert; that is, it won't 
            react with chemicals like those in detergents and is resistant to water and heat. Many other parts 
            including the basket for cutlery, containers for detergent, and the wash tower and spray arms are 
            also injection molded.</p>
